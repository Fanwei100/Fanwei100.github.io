Abstract：Displaying High Dynamic Range (HDR) video on an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display aged for 1200 hours produced noticeable color shifting in the HDR mode playback. The experiment and measurements on commercial high end OLED panels from two different companies prove the damaging effect and introduces a proposed measurement system to quantify the color shift in aged OLED panels.
