Abstractï¼šDisplaying High Dynamic Range (HDR) video on an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display aged for 1200 hours
produced noticeable color shifting in the HDR mode playback.
The experiment and measurements on commercial high end
OLED panels from two different companies prove the damaging
effect and introduces a proposed measurement system to quantify
the color shift in aged OLED panels.
